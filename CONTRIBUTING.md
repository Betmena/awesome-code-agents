# Contributing to awesome-code-agents

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this curated list of AI-powered code agents and development tools!

## How to Contribute

### Adding a New Code Agent

1. **Research the tool** to gather accurate information about its features and official website/repository
2. **Determine the appropriate category** for the tool:
   - AI-Enhanced IDEs & Editors / AI增强型IDE和编辑器
   - Terminal-Based AI Agents / 终端AI智能体
   - VS Code Extensions / VS Code扩展
   - Web-Based Development Platforms / 基于Web的开发平台
   - Enterprise & Platform Solutions / 企业和平台解决方案
   - Specialized Tools / 专用工具
3. **Add the entry to both files** using the format:
   - English (README.md): `- **[{{name}}]({{link}})**, {{short description}}`
   - Chinese (README.zh-CN.md): `- **[{{name}}]({{link}})**，{{Chinese short description}}`
4. **Keep descriptions concise** (under 15 words) and focus on the main functionality
5. **Ensure the link** points to the official website or main repository
6. **Add new entries to the end** of the appropriate category in both files (do not maintain alphabetical order)

### Chinese Translation Guidelines

When contributing to the Chinese version (README.zh-CN.md):
- Use proper Chinese technical terminology
- Keep the same concise style as English descriptions
- Use Chinese punctuation (，。) instead of English punctuation
- **Follow 盘古之白 formatting**: Add spaces between Chinese and English/numbers (e.g., "AI 代码编辑器", "支持 100+ 种语言", "VS Code 扩展")
- Maintain consistency with existing Chinese translations
- Both English and Chinese versions should be updated simultaneously

### Submission Guidelines

- Make sure the tool is actively maintained and publicly available
- Verify that the link works and points to the correct resource
- Check that the tool isn't already listed in the repository
- Use clear, descriptive language in the description
- Focus on the tool's primary AI/coding assistance features

### Using Claude Code to Add New Entries

You can use Claude Code to help add new code agents efficiently:

1. **Research with Claude Code**: Ask Claude Code to research a new tool and gather information about its features, category, and official links
2. **Get proper formatting**: Claude Code can help format the entry correctly using the `- **[{{name}}]({{link}})**, {{short description}}` format
3. **Category placement**: Claude Code can determine the most appropriate category and add the entry to the end of that section
4. **Description optimization**: Ask Claude Code to create a concise description under 15 words that captures the tool's main functionality

Example commands: 
- `Add [tool name] to both README.md and README.zh-CN.md under the appropriate category with descriptions`
- `Add [tool name] to the README files with English and Chinese descriptions`
